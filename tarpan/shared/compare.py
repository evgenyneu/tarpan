    """
    Calculate weights of the model that can be used for rough comparison.

    The code is taken from `compare` function of stats.py file
    of arviz library (https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz), version 0.6.1,

    Parameters
    ----------
    deviances: 2D array
        An array containing WAIC or PSIS values for each model and observations
        Rows are models and columns are observations.

    b_samples: int
        Number of samples taken by the Bayesian bootstrap estimation.

    Returns
    -------
    list:
        Weight of each of the model. Higher value means the model
        is more compatible with the data.
