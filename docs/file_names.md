# Where does Tarpan puts summary and plot files?

By default, all files are placed into `model_info/CODEFILE` directory. Here, `CODEFILE` is a sub-directory that has the same name as your python script file.

For example, suppose you called Tarpan's `save_summary` function from a script file called `make_plots.py`. In this case, Tarpan will create a summary file at `model_info/make_lots/summary.txt` location.
